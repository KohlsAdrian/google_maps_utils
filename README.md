# An Android Google Maps Utils original java project port for Flutter

A Flutter/Dart project based on Android Google Maps Utils converted/ported to Dart/Flutter
There are many packages that features Google Maps Utils, but none has the 3 main classes
from the sources

## Status: 3 of 78 classes converted

This is a project for converting all of the tools from Android Google Maps Utils partially.
Initial commits from the 3 main Classes, MathUtils.java, PolyUtils.java and SphericalUtils.java
The same rules for calculating bounds, distance between two Point points and other polyline features are the same as used on Android native Java/Kotlin logic.
All of the methods of current classes available are ported
You can request classes for me to port as an issue, the classes ported are what most people uses

## Example *.dart

```dart
    import 'package:google_maps_utils/google_maps_utils.dart';

    void main() {
        Point from = Point(0.0, 0.0);
        Point to = Point(10.0, 5.0);
        Point randomPoint = Point(-23.54545, -23.898098);

        double distance = SphericalUtils.computeDistanceBetween(from, to);
        print('Distance: $distance meters');

        double heading = SphericalUtils.computeHeading(from, to);
        print('Heading: $heading degrees');

        double angle = SphericalUtils.computeAngleBetween(from, to);
        print('Angle: $angle degrees');

        double distanceToAB = PolyUtils.distanceToLine(randomPoint, from, to);
        print('Distance to Line: $distanceToAB meters');

        /// Distance: 1241932.6430813475
        /// Heading: 26.302486345342523
        /// Angle: 0.19493500057547358
        /// Distance to Line: 3675538.1518512294

        /// See grid path on: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm

        List<Point> path = PolyUtils.decode(
            'wjiaFz`hgQs}GmmBok@}vX|cOzKvvT`uNutJz|UgqAglAjr@ijBz]opA|Vor@}ViqEokCaiGu|@byAkjAvrMgjDj_A??ey@abD');

        print('path size length: ${path.length}');

        List<Point> simplifiedPath = PolyUtils.simplify(path, 5000);
        String simplifiedPathEncoded = PolyUtils.encode(simplifiedPath);

        print('simplified path: $simplifiedPathEncoded');
        print('path size simplified length: ${simplifiedPath.length}');


        /// Example by: https://github.com/nicolascav
        Point point = Point(-31.623060136389135, -60.68669021129609);

        /// Triangle
        List<Point> polygon = [
            Point(-31.624115, -60.688734),
            Point(-31.624115, -60.684657),
            Point(-31.621594, -60.686717),
            Point(-31.624115, -60.688734),
        ];

        bool contains = PolyUtils.containsLocationPoly(point, polygon);
        print('point is inside polygon?: $contains');

        /// And Many more
    }
````
